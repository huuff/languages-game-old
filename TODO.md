* Some more cases for persistence
* Or maybe switch it for key-value
* Add type hinting
* Show a table with results
* On tasks.py, maybe the dict isn't even necessary, can't a finder discover the modules?
* Logging on pre and post timeout
* Look for a way to prevent recompilation on each run if nothing is changed
* Finish long commands better
* Supposedly, the idiomatic way to get command output is ussing subprocess.check_output(), I should look into it
