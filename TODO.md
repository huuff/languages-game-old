* Some more cases for persistence
* Or maybe switch it for key-value
* Add type hinting
* Show a table with results
* On tasks.py, maybe the dict isn't even necessary, can't a finder discover the modules?
* Better logging when printing command output
* Logging on pre and post timeout
* Look for a way to prevent recompilation on each run if nothing is changed
* Finish long commands better
