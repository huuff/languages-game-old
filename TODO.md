* Add type hinting
* Show a table with results
* On tasks.py, maybe the dict isn't even necessary, can't a finder discover the modules?
* Logging on pre and post timeout
* Look for a way to prevent recompilation on each run if nothing is changed
* Kill long commands better, there are a number of ways they could still be running
* Supposedly, the idiomatic way to get command output is using subprocess.check_output(), I should look into it
* Implement some way of after each for key-value
