* Put logs in appropriate places
* Some more cases for persistence
* Or maybe switch it for key-value
* Add type hinting
* Show a table with results
* Set config from command line arguments
* Better timeout logging (add input, specify level)
* On tasks.py, maybe the dict isn't even necessary, can't a finder discover the modules?
